The idea of this project is, to roll out a scalable Econometrics class library for Python. 
This toolkit is supposed to provide both implementations for the most commonly 
used econometric models, and base classes and interfaces for new models and 
methods to be developed. The functionality will heavily rely on the 
Python libraries NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib.
